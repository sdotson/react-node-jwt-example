# React Redux JWT authentication example

This is an example of React Redux JWT authentication with a Node server. This was created with the help of Stephen Grider's Advanced React Redux course on Udemy: https://www.udemy.com/react-redux-tutorial

It was challenging for me to find a simple example of how to implement authentication with React Redux and Node, so I hope this may help others.

## Running

1. `npm run setup`
2. Start mongo on you machine: `mongod`
3. Start dev server: `npm run startServer`
4. Start the client within `public` directory by typing `webpack-dev-server`
5. Visit http://localhost:8080
